# DOMTokenList polyfill

A super strict polyfill for [DOMTokenList](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#interface-domtokenlist).

## Usage
All you need to do is include the JavaScript file and everything will be ready to go.
If native DOMTokenList support is detected, nothing will be done.

```
<script src="DOMTokenList.js"></script>
```
